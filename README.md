# Iris-Dataset-using-Machine-Learning-Model
In this project I had use Iris Dataset from kaggle and use different Machine Learning Model to predict its three categories-
1) Iris-setosa 
2)Iris-Versicolor
3)Iris-Verginica 
I had used 3 Machine Learning Models for comparitive study of this project. 
1)Logistic Regression
2)KMeans Clustering
3)SVM Machine Learning Model using different kernels(like-linear,rbf,poly etc)
